For those who care about the nitty-gritty about what the Ability Ratings actually mean in terms of chance of success, this article is for you.

{% include toc.html %}

## Base Mechanic

The basic FS3 mechanic is Attribute + Skill number of 8-sided dice against a target number of 6.

## Chance of Success

On a routine roll, here is the chance of getting various numbers of successes based on the **total** number of dice (attribute + skill).

> <i class="fa fa-cubes" aria-hidden="true"></i>  Tasks in FS3 require only a single success, so even modest skill ratings (Competent or higher) give you a good chance of success on average rolls.  Higher ratings give you more of an edge in opposed rolls and difficult tasks.

| Total Dice | 1+ Success | 2+ Success | 3+ Success | 
| ---- |---- |---- |---- |---- |
|3 (Everyman)|76%| 32% | 5% | 
|4 (Fair)|85%| 48% | 15% |
|5 (Competent)|90%| 62% | 28% | 
|6 (Good)|94%| 73% | 40% | 
|7 (Great)|96%| 81% | 52% | 
|8 (Extraordinary)|98%| 86% | 63% | 
|9 (Amazing)|99%| 91% | 72% | 
|10 (Legendary)|99%| 94% | 79% |

## Effect of Modifiers

Higher skill ratings insulate you against modifiers, letting you have a good chance of success even when the going gets tough.  Modifiers do not equate to a raw % -- you cannot say that -1 is -10% or anything like that.  The effect of a modifier depends on their original skill, as shown in the chart below.

| Total Dice | No Modifier | -1 Modifier | -2 Modifier | -3 Modifier |
| ---- |
|3 (Everyman)|76%|	60%|	37%|	37%|
|4 (Fair)|85%|	76%|	60%|	37%|
|5 (Competent)|90%|	85%|	76%|	60%|
|6 (Good)|94%|	90%|	85%|	76%|
|7 (Great)|96%|	94%|	90%|	85%|
|8 (Extraordinary)|98%|	96%|	94%|	90%|
|9 (Amazing)|99%|	98%|	96%|	94%|
|10 (Legendary)|99%|	99%|	98%|	96%|

Consider Competent Carla (3 skill + 2 attribute) vs. Extraordinary Edward (6 skill + 2 attribute).  If you give both a -3 modifier, Calra's chance just went from 90% to 60%, but Edward's was only reduced from 98% to 90%.  Edward, with his higher skill, is better able to adapt to the challenging circumstances.

## Multiple Successes vs. Modifiers

In FS3, a single success is enough to accomplish a task.  If a task is hard, applying a modifier is better than requiring multiple successes. Here is why it matters.  

Consider Fair Frank (2 skill + 2 attribute) and Good Greta (4 skill + 2 attribute).  The chart below shows their original success chance, compared to the chance of success with a -2 modifier and the chance of success if you require a "Good Success" on the roll (3 successes).

Notice that requiring a "Good Success" makes your chance of success _dramatically_ lower.  Poor Frank has almost no chance at all. In fact, you have to have a total die pool of 7 before you even have a 50/50 chance of getting a 'Good Success' on a roll.

## Expected Successes

Technically the _possible_ number of successes is always 0 up to the total number of dice.  But in practice, some results are extraordinarily unlikely.  This chart shows you how many successes are actually _practical_.

* Average Successes = Mathematical average number of successes.
* Expected Range = Excluding results that are less than 5% likely, what is the actual range of successes you can expect.

| Total Dice | Average Successes | Expected Range |
| ---- |---- |---- |
| 3 |1 | 0-2 |
| 4 | 1.5 | 0-3 |
| 5|1.875 | 0-4 |
| 6|2.25 | 0-4 |
| 7|2.625 | 0-5 |
| 8|3 | 1-5 |
| 9|3.375 | 1-6 |
| 10|3.75 | 1-7 |

## Modifiers vs Opposed Rolls

Opposed rolls are meant for _active_ challenges, like other characters.  Using opposed rolls, even with low skill levels, can have a far more dramatic impact on your chances of success than even significant modifiers.

## Big Bads / Superhuman Rolls

FS3 does not scale for beyond-human abilities.  Games that want to have superhumans (mutants, jedi, wookiees, etc.) or "big bads" should be aware of this.  Here is a chart that illustrates the problem.

The blue is a regular human rolling 7 dice.   On average he gets between 2-3 successes, but on a lucky roll he might get up to 7.

The red is our Super rolling 20 dice.  On average they get between 7-8 successes, so yes - they will win most of the time.  The regular human can’t even touch their lucky rolls of 10+ successes.

But sometimes the Super rolls that fistful of dice and ends up with only a few successes.  That’s the shaded section in the middle, and that’s where our regular human can win or tie.  It happens more often than you might think.

There's a more in-depth discussion of this in the blog post [Scaling in FS3](https://aresmush.wordpress.com/2019/07/18/scaling-in-fs3/).
