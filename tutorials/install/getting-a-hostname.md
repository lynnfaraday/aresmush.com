Host names are optional - you can always connect to a game using its IP address.  But it's nice to have a host name (like yourmush.somemuhost.com) so people can remember your game address more easily.

Most VPS servers (including Digital Ocean) don't include a host name. If you want a name, you'll have to set one up separately.

## AresMUSH Domain

You can request an AresMUSH sub-domain (yourmush.aresmush.com) by [contacting me directly](/feedback.html).  AresMUSH sub-domains are given out at my sole discretion, and at no charge.

## Custom Domain

You can also register a custom domain name (yourmush.com) for just a few dollars a year.  Once you have a domain, you will need to create an "A Record" DNS entry and point it at the IP address of your droplet.  The steps will vary depending on the domain provider. See [Setting Up Domain Hosting With Namecheap](/tutorials/install/setting-up-dns.html) for an example.
